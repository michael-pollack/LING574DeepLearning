Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act.
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left.
In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organisations.
Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.
I do not have these concerns.
Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission' s communication is ill-considered.
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?
Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves.
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.
It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.
The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights, for that would be the enemy of freedom, justice and security.
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies.
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million.
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain.
This is not covered by the directive.
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards.
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice.
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.
I say they have a right to solidarity.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.
I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.
Mr President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return, with respect for their own heritage and their own culture.
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.
(NL) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger' s speech, after which I will, of course, listen with all due attention to the next speakers. If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate.
In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening, a number of groups - the Group of the European People' s Party, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda' s report were brought forward in the agenda.
What we have here is an ecological disaster.
These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain.
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together, as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today shows.
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times.
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned.
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.
We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly.
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives.
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but we need to work effectively together.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained.
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process.
There are four more sister ships in service at present.
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office.
What is to be done with this money?
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.
This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn.
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.
This programme covers the period 1998 to 2002, and the reference amount for its implementation is EUR 12 million.
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments.
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.
I ask for your support.
I believe that is a good thing
In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model.
(Applause)
I share the Commission' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.
The rural regions eligible under Objective 5b will be included among the main victims of this situation: in France, 27% of the populations eligible for Structural Funds are going to lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period, a figure which is occasionally much larger in some regions such as the Loire region, Alsace or Lower Normandy, political strongholds of the right-wing that were the victims of the petty political vote chasing of the left-wing coalition government.
Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died.
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear.
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports.
On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated.
They want answers.
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries.
Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision.
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this.
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.
Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who gave its opinion.
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels.
Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.
In March 1998, the Council adopted the Odysseus programme, a programme of training, exchanges and cooperation in the fields of policy on asylum, immigration and crossing of external borders.
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.
Yet, every year we have the same problem.
But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use.
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97.
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.
This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union, in other words the Commission and also the Council, can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation.
Well, patently, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting, on the basis of Rule 50, we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments, enabling some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free, regular, peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State.
All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services.
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected?
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing.
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated.
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay, at the expense of the environment.
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded.
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter.
Let me thank you, Madam President, for your contribution on behalf of Parliament.
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.
Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts.
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.
We need to take this responsibility seriously.
We disagree with many of the report' s views.
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well.
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.
We understand that, and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism.
Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment.
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion.
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government.
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe' s economy.
On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles?
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative.
We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords.
In this area we must respond to public opinion.
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone.
All over the world, Europe' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities.
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.
We also intend to initiate a new debate, a more innovative one, on the issue of Europe' s film heritage, given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy.
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures.
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.
We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.
Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore.
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.
Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.
We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria.
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.
Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security.
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis?
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.
It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo.
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission' s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions.
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.
Secondly, speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify.
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.
This constitutes a good example, therefore.
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.
Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States.
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe.
Who will provide us with new jobs?
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this.
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency?
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular.
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets.
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union.
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas.
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.
These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty.
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000)
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined.
It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11.
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration.
This message must be very clear; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow.
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible, we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments, and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects, including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.
This body, for example, alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety, is already doing good work.
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed, provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity.
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.
Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent.
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed.
However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law.
It is something that is earned over a period of time.
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings, primarily about our values.
In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities.
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.
Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight.
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted.
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party.
Let me give you three examples.
However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other.
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe.
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point.
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual.
Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.
RINA is currently the talk of the town.
That is the one word I am talking about.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I am very concerned about these translation problems which, unfortunately, we seem to be having increasingly, and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed.
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment.
However, before the elections we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens.
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.
.
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo.
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.
There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment.
However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi.
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.
Europe was born out of a desire for peace, freedom and tolerance.
Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new.
In the final analysis, however, we must find a way forward, because if we carry on as we have in the past, and with last year' s experience, then what will happen is that the security debate and the debate about citizens' rights will be marginalised in the national parliaments as a result of making it a half national, half European structure.
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.
There is now a new Commission.
It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.
We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months.
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility.
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration.
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer' s liability and the requirement for recycling.
We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level.
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it.
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?
(SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference.
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today.
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights.
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product' s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.
I now come to the content of the report.
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.
Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned. It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves.
We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council' s functions as a legislative body.
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information?
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated.
Why are there no fire instructions?
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy' s report, the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention, the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, finally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes, on the basis of a real partnership.
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies.
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.
Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people' s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission' s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration.
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.
Where is the beef?
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.
My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.
In view of this situation, renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, to create a tax on currency transactions. The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments, but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation, thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions.
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts.
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.
In no case, however, are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature.
.
I hope that we can thrash this out.
(Applause)
Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.
However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents.
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation, and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject.
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission.
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees, the topic of the debate.
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture, to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, diversification and job creation.
A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.
In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries.
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation.
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.
Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice.
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.
Just as important in my view is not to broaden the selection criteria for URBAN II too much and thus water them down.
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents.
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones.
I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak.
Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest.
Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.
It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality.
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful.
However, I would like to say, Mr Newton Dunn, that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable.
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy.
That is a reduction of 3¾ % compared with the previous CIs.
Certainly, in the first instance, as far as Austrian political leaders are concerned, it is a matter of answering this existential question for the future of democracy, starting with those who have just taken the inordinate risk of giving the extreme right a boost.
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass.
They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role.
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union' s institutions.
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.
That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament.
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Prodi and the Commission on their government policy statement.
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government.
I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.
Mr Gollnisch, excuse me, you have one minute.
Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track.
Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles.
The INTERREG initiative, launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations, sits comfortably within this philosophy.
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this.
I am far keener to see us move away from today's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg. This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation.
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.
Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country.
The Commission?
If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens.
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions.
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings.
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks".
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them.
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.
Mr President, first of all, I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report, Mrs Stenzel, very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out.
Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts.
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget.
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged.
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.
It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay.
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations.
Let us stop the shadow-boxing.
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments.
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.
Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice.
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase.
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.
This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union. These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us.
I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again.
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.
Let me explain.
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late.
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system.
That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.
For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4.
I can show you a copy if you wish.
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs.
The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that.
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism.
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.
Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible.
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other.
The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health.
I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments.
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.
In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy.
Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.
Before the vote at the plenary sitting, new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee.
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year, with or without Israel' s support.
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute.
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers.
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol, and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation.
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights.
Mr President, the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news, but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people.
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market.
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.
I have heard, Mr Poettering, that you have been following events in Austria.
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April.
Looking at foreign policy, Madam President, I very much like the ambition that the European Union should have as much political as economic say at world level.
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue.
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference' s agenda.
However, saying is one thing and doing is another!
The question is: who prosecutes?
It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved.
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.
The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished.
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction.
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy.
Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity.
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.
I feel, finally, that this is a case of political decline of the European Union as such and it therefore also sends a negative message outside the Union, when we are speaking in the name of democracy and human rights.
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.
The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation.
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future.
(Applause)
Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes, high unemployment, substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency.
In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation.
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.
When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.
In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life.
Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.
Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines.
Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development, the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy. However, housing is specifically excluded.
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence.
In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population.
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships.
Question Time (Commission)
Mr President, Mrs Theato' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist.
1997 discharge
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal?
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.
Lastly, in today' s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected.
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly.
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.
As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate.
But we all want to be oarsmen on it. We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.
Our answer to this crucial question is no.
It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays.
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.
From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds.
Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development.
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise.
Market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies.
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake.
The project has been long and problematic.
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.
In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents.
That is why we need transparency.
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria.
However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.
At the Commission' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.
This is in place too.
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution. That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.
Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.
But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France, including British student, Isabel Peake, who was thrown off a train, shows why we need mutual recognition. Arrested and released in Madrid, he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon.
The common position is a reasonable compromise.
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital.
This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union.
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission.
Following a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly in the next month.
It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question.
Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.
But the Member States failed to cooperate.
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr Gasòliba.
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.
All good things come in threes, especially in our policy area.
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week.
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue.
I shall, however, mention the Spanish Socialist Party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of Albacete and which settled its accounts with Basque nationalists by hiring contract killers.
I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively, with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible, not only in terms of its application, but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives.
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission.
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.
Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange.
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there.
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm.
The danger is too great for us to ignore.
We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.
You have to see this as a tool for risk management.
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.
The second principle in the Council' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive.
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to focus on the point of internal reform.
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.
First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite.
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU' s overall agricultural policy.
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
However, justice delayed is justice denied, and we must reflect on this notion.
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"
(Applause)
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.
The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities.
Not a euro more or a euro less.
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region.
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.
And secondly: are we reducing the European car industry' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal?
Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance.
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead.
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission.
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.
I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion. One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion.
Many speakers have underlined this.
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself.
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply.
Mr President, everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question.
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States.
How are we going to assess the results of these five years?
If the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice is kept secret, then we shall not win the citizens over to it.
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?
I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low.
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.
In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress.
I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland.
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.
I counted no less than seven calls in the resolution, at different points, for equal rights for European citizens and legal immigrants.
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.
So what are we to do now?
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II.
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas.
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.
It could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty.
Subject: Farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares?
You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.
Change in the law is fundamental.
That cannot continue.
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change.
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions.
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.
We are talking about macrofinancial aid.
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap.
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.
The first principle means creating a new 'pact' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside' s recreation value.
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric.
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, 'Shaping the new Europe' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all.
Secondly, the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training.
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted.
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence.
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind.
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.
Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive. Cars are also part of our cultural heritage.
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.
Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position.
Just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries.
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east.
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.
We need more explanation of what Europe is about.
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already, for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, but also by others - there is a need for more supervision.
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice.
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?
Mr Dimitrakopoulos, transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions.
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal.
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind.
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application.
I think that the answer is brief and clear.
It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation.
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative.
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax?
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s watchdog.
Again, this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity.
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.
Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.
How are priorities supposed to be set here?
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche.
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm!
There is absolutely nothing in the resolution on border controls. Even when the question of Eurodac or readmission clauses is briefly mentioned, it is only to deplore the over-strictness of the Council on these subjects.
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I fully support the thinking of the proposals made by my colleague, Mrs Hautala, on the Commission' s strategic objectives for the coming five years.
It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.
The combination of these two positions makes for a mixture which could be disastrous for the future for Europe.
This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice.
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments.
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive.
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position.
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet.
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution.
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights.
Thank you, Minister.
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community.
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case.
I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level.
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car.
However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation.
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.
The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.
Are these reports accurate?
Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty.
According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.
I think we would all agree on that.
Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn.
Is there anyone to speak in favour of this proposal?
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.
What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party, which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals, via Vandam and Agusta?
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.
That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them.
The common position stipulates 2006.
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive.
Such a concern is misplaced.
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.
There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament, including two Greek, one Portuguese, one Finnish and one Belgian, but still no Dutch, and as many as seven English, six German and six French.
That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house' s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years!
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.
We too want to help put Europe on its feet.
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because, as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence.
Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities.
Madam President, on a point of order.
However, it is not under threat from Europe.
A number of codes have since been introduced.
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion.
Why do I say that culture is important?
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group.
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence.
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.
We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies, this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances.
Much like in the Netherlands, where, at a given point, women woke up to the fact that, by referring to European legislation, they could improve their status in terms of social security, this is now also the case for scores of other citizens.
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result.
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?
And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity.
To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.
The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences.
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment.
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?
Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases.
Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.
In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.
At the same time, we are aware that this is a massive programme and that, during the overhaul in the next couple of years, it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in, as before.
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.
This is a generalised tendency, sparing neither the Rhône-Alpes, nor Alsace.
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today's session.
VOTE
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together.
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.
The next item is the joint debate on:
It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure. Is this possible?
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated.
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.
A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.
The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage.
Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem.
Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations?
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.
The time for resolutions has passed.
Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important.
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome.
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.
